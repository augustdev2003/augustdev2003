I've been a chemical technician for two years, but it wasn't something I was passionate about and I decided to look for an alternative, until I discovered the world of software development.

For a year and a few months that I have been studying and practicing programming, I have seen many of the branches of this profession, being very interested in Web Development, especially in the Backend.

I'm very excited to continue exploring and discovering new paths that programming can give me.
